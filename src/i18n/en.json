    "subtitle": "I'm a food coach who helps you transform your grocery shopping and cooking routine into a sustainable, healthy lifestyle — without spending hours in the kitchen or eating boring food. You can cook for your entire family and still hit your fitness goals, even on a calorie deficit. After years of experimenting with cooking, weight management, and working with nutritionists, I've identified the pain points we all struggle with on our weight control journey — and found science-based answers on how to prevent your brain and body from sabotaging you. I'll show you how to get the nutrients you need to avoid cravings and overeating habits that derail weight loss. Plus, I offer motivational support groups and individual coaching — because accountability is often the hardest part when you're on your own in your weight management journey.",
