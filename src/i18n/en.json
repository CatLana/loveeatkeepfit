  "story": {
    "heading": "Why I created this method",
    "paragraph1": "I didn’t struggle with weight so much as with the “all or nothing” mindset — and I watched people I care about get trapped in cycles of strict rules, cravings, and rebound weight gain.",
    "paragraph2": "One night habit changed everything for me: eating perfectly all day, then overeating at night. That pattern taught me the hard way that restriction creates rebellion. When I shifted to a balanced approach — tasty, satisfying meals and strategies to manage triggers — my body responded and the weight came off without suffering.",
    "neuro": "I bring a bit of neuroscience into the method so you understand why cravings happen and how hormones and habits drive behaviour.",
    "mission": "You don’t have to suffer to lose weight. You can enjoy food and still be healthy. You can stop fighting yourself."
