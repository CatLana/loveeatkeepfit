    "subtitle": "I'm a food coach who helps you transform your grocery shopping and cooking routine into a sustainable, healthy lifestyle — without spending hours in the kitchen or eating boring food. You can cook for your entire family and still hit your fitness goals, even on a calorie deficit. After years of experimenting with cooking, weight management, and working with nutritionists, I've identified the pain points we all struggle with on our weight control journey — and found science-based answers on how to prevent your brain and body from sabotaging you. I'll show you how to get the nutrients you need to avoid cravings and overeating habits that derail weight loss. Plus, I offer motivational support groups and individual coaching — because accountability is often the hardest part when you're on your own in your weight management journey.",

    "heading": "Why I created this method",
    "paragraph1": "I didn’t struggle with weight so much as with the “all or nothing” mindset — and I watched people I care about get trapped in cycles of strict rules, cravings, and rebound weight gain.",
    "paragraph2": "One night habit changed everything for me: eating perfectly all day, then overeating at night. That pattern taught me the hard way that restriction creates rebellion. When I shifted to a balanced approach — tasty, satisfying meals and strategies to manage triggers — my body responded and the weight came off without suffering.",
    "neuro": "I bring a bit of neuroscience into the method so you understand why cravings happen and how hormones and habits drive behaviour.",
    "mission": "You don’t have to suffer to lose weight. You can enjoy food and still be healthy. You can stop fighting yourself."
